# Edge-Detection-on-Images-using-OpenCV
This project demonstrates how to perform edge detection on images using the Canny Edge Detection algorithm with OpenCV in Python.

# Requirements
- Python
- OpenCV
- Google Colab (or local Python environment)

# How it Works
- User Uploads an image.
# the model:
- Convert the image to grayscale.
- Apply the Canny Edge Detection algorithm.
- Display the original and edge-detected images side by side.
